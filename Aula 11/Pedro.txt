Pedro by Shel Silverstein

Pedro loves me,
Pedro cares,
Pedro picks me peaches and pears.
Pedro offers me candy and Cokes,
Pedro listens and laughs at me jokes.
Pedro helps when I get in a fight,
Pedro does all my homework at night.
Pedro misses me,
Pedro cries,
Pedro thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Pedro is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Pedro just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Pedro's hand,
In the darkness where Pedro usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Pedro's gone!
